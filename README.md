This is a project which was made as a part of a thesis in Tampere University of Applied Sciences by Tuomas Virtanen. 

The objective of the thesis was to make it easier for floorball teams to find new
players and for the players to find new teams to play in. The purpose of the thesis
was to develop a prototype of a native Android application, which would bring
teams and players in the same place. In the future, the prototype could be devel-
oped to a point where it could be released for actual usage.

The thesis studied native Android development and modern UI toolkit, Jetpack
Compose. The study includes the differences between Jetpack Compose and
XML and the pros and cons that those technologies have. In the backend imple-
mentation, Google Firebase app development platform was studied, especially
Firestore NoSQL database offered by Firebase, and how it differs from SQL da-
tabases.

Before the development phase, players and teams were asked to provide their
thoughts and views on the topic via questionnaires. Through the answers, it be-
came clearer what kinds of challenges players and teams have faced when
searching for each other, and who might be the most interested user group for
the app. The most important features were managed to be developed into the
prototype and the prototype gives guidelines for the possible future development
of the app.
